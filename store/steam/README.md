# Store/Steam

Steam uses BBCode, therefore all files in this directory contain `BBCode` and have the `.txt` extension. 

## Formatting

Steam has two sections for a Store Page.

- Short Description
- Long Description

The file format is `<LANG>_<SHORT|LONG>_DESC.txt` where `<LANG>` is the standard [ISO639 Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes)
